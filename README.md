# LectureSelector
A little tool to Select your Online-Lecture or get a Notification if one starts in the next 5 Minutes.

# Requirements
- JRE 11
- Lectures ;)

# Usage
You can simply start the jar via terminal, after that you will have a little SystemTray Icon with Sample Lectures. <br>
If you want to change them you can open the Settings. <br>
Optional you can add a CalDav Account (testes with NextCloud) to get System Notifications 5 minutes before the Lecture starts.
But this Feature is just working if you name your Lectures the same like in your calendar.<br>
All Settings are stored in your home directory if you want to share them you can just send them to a friend and reuse the config.<br>
BUT ItÂ´s not recommended to share the CalDav Settings.
